# ImportObjectsFromExcelUsingEPPlus
Demonstrates how Simio can import model information from an Excel spreadsheet using the open source EPPlus package (from GitHub).
It Imports fixed objects, Links, and Vertices.
It also demonstrates how to import Simio Properties for Objects and Links.
Usage:
Clone the project. Make sure all references are correct. This design-time DLL will attempt to run Simio from the program files > Simio LLC > Simio > Simio.exe
Download the example Excel spreadsheet ( ImportObjectsLinksVertices.xlsx )
When Simio runs, go to Project Home and select Actions from the ribbon and browse to the Excel file you downloaded.
It will build a small model with a source-server-sink and some links.
Run it and watch!
